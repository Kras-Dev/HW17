# Project with automated testing

This project is designed to learn about automated testing using popular tools. Here you can see how these tools interact and are used in a variety of improvements.

## About the project

In this project we practice writing automated tests using the following tools:

- JUnit: for writing and running unit tests.
- Mockito: for creating and working with mocks (fake objects).
- WireMock: for creating and emulating external HTTP requests and APIs.
- Selenium/Selenide: to automate web interface testing.
- Allure: for test result reporting and visualization.
- Rest Assured: for API testing.

## Resources Tested

We tested the following resources in our automated tests:
- [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/): Used for API testing.
- [Boni Garcia's Selenium WebDriver Java](https://bonigarcia.dev/selenium-webdriver-java/): Used for web interface testing.

## How to start
