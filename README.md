# Project with automated testing

This project was created to study automated testing using popular tools such as JUnit, Mockito, WireMock and Selenium. To see how these tools are integrated and used in dozens of improvements.

## About the project

In this project we practice writing automated tests using the following tools:

- JUnit: for writing and running unit tests.

- Selenium: to automate web interface testing.
- Allure: for test result reporting and visualization.
